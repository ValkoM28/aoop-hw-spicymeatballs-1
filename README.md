## This is the homework repo of the group named Spicy Meatballs. 
Every folder is one homework assignment and has its own readme to clarify required stuff. 

Everyone going through this repo that is not Maximilian (our professor) nor his TAs keep in mind that this is no resource for learning good practices and the code should most likely not be done the way you can see here. 

## If you are still determined, proceed with caution. 

### And lastly, if you need to practice fixing someone else's code, this is definitely the right place for you! 

Good luck sailing these seas. 

Sincerely,
Spicy Meatballs.
